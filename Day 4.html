      Kabaddi is a popular traditional sport of India that combines strength,
      speed, agility, and strategy. It originated in ancient India and has been
      played for centuries, especially in rural areas. Today, kabaddi is
      recognized as a professional sport and is played at national and
      international levels. The Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) has played a major role
      in making the sport popular among the youth and across the world. Kabaddi
      is a team sport played between two teams, each consisting of seven players
      on the field. The game is played on a rectangular court divided into two
      halves. The main objective of the game is for a player, known as the
      “raider,” to enter the opponent’s half, tag as many defenders as possible,
      and return safely to their own half without being tackled. During the
      raid, the raider must continuously chant the word “kabaddi” to prove that
      they are not taking a breath. If the raider stops chanting, the raid is
      considered invalid. Each successful tag gives one point to the raiding
      team, while the defending team earns points by successfully tackling the
      raider. Players who are tagged or tackled are temporarily out of the game
      and can be revived when their team scores points. This rule makes the game
      highly strategic, as teams must balance offense and defense carefully. The
      match is usually played in two halves of 20 minutes each, with a short
      break in between. Kabaddi requires excellent physical fitness, quick
      reflexes, and strong teamwork. Raiders need speed, flexibility, and clever
      movements to escape defenders, while defenders must work together using
      techniques like ankle holds, thigh holds, and chain tackles. Mental
      strength is equally important, as players must make quick decisions under
      pressure. Apart from physical benefits, kabaddi also teaches discipline,
      leadership, and coordination. It is an inexpensive sport that requires
      minimal equipment, making it accessible to people from all backgrounds.
      Over the years, kabaddi has grown beyond India and is now played in
      countries like Iran, South Korea, Japan, and Bangladesh. With increasing
      global recognition and professional leagues, kabaddi continues to inspire
      millions and remains a proud symbol of India’s sporting heritage.
