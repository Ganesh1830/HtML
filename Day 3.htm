      <b>What is Git? </b><br />
      Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds
      in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then. It is used
      for: Tracking code changes Tracking who made changes Coding collaboration
      Key Git Concepts Repository: A folder where Git tracks your project and
      its history. Clone: Make a copy of a remote repository on your computer.
      Stage: Tell Git which changes you want to save next. Commit: Save a
      snapshot of your staged changes. Branch: Work on different versions or
      features at the same time. Merge: Combine changes from different branches.
      Pull: Get the latest changes from a remote repository. Push: Send your
      changes to a remote repository. Working with Git Initialize Git on a
      folder, making it a Repository Git now creates a hidden folder to keep
      track of changes in that folder When a file is changed, added or deleted,
      it is considered modified You select the modified files you want to Stage
      The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent
      snapshot of the files Git allows you to see the full history of every
      commit. You can revert back to any previous commit. Git does not store a
      separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes
      made in each commit!
